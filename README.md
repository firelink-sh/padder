padder is a lightweight Rust crate for padding and formatting data structures at runtime efficiently. It provides fine-grained control over alignment, truncating strategies, padding, and memory allocation - making it ideal for performance-critical applications.

Unlike the builtin `format!` macro, padder avoids unnecessary repeated heap allocations and lets you
pad and format directly into preallocated buffers.

**Fully UTF-8 compatible** - padder works seamlessly with any Unicode characters like emojis (üêâ), Japanese kana/kanji („Åì„Çì„Å´„Å°„ÅØ), or other multibyte symbols, when operating on String types.

## Features

- Pad strings, slices, and vectors with custom alignment and width.
- Zero-cost abstractions via the `Source` and `MutableSource` traits.
- Pad directly into buffers for fine-grained heap allocation control.
- Highly extensible to custom types through the provided traits.


## Installation

Add to you project with Cargo:

```
cargo add padder

(available features)
 - enable_unsafe
```


## Benchmarks

Run `cargo bench` to compare performance against the builtin `format!` macro. The benchmarks are organized by source type, feature, and alignment strategy.

To benchmark the `enable_unsafe` feature to verify that the use of `unsafe` actually improves performance on your system, run the following: 

```
cargo bench --bench enable_unsafe --features enable_unsafe
```
